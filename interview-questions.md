# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast arrays and hashes in Ruby. Include at least two differences and two similarities.

Your answer: in ruby both hashes and arrays are used to store collections of data, and they can both be iterated through using similar methods such as .map and .each. as for differences hashes store data in key-value pairs, while arrays store data in an index. another difference is how you would access the values within each collection of data, in a hash to get the value you would have to call on the key while in an array you would have to call on its index which is an integer and the first element starts at 0.

Researched answer: in ruby both hashes and arrays are both used to store collections of data and they can be looped through their elements using methods like .each and .map. some differences include how the data is stored and how to access the data.

2. What does it mean to implement a TTD workflow?

Your answer: implementing test-driven development allows for developers to run tests before writing actual code which can ensure that adding new features do not break previous code. 

Researched answer: TTD promotes a more systematic and disciplined approach to software development, ensuring that the code is thoroughly tested and that new features do not break existing functionality.

3. Why would super be used in a Ruby class?
